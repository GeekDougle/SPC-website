Talking about exciting tech is a passion of mine!  The conversations engineers/students/leaders have in the office or elsewhere build a community and foster a collaboration that is central to the goal of building cool stuff.

It is with this in mind that I am offering a [Complimentary 1hr video/phone meeting per month per client](https://calendar.app.google/F5mJp5e4rjaATwhA8)!

Prior Topics have included, but aren't limited to:
- Design reviews (limited complexity & depth)
- Electrical engineering brainstorming
- Prototyping
- Firmware development
- Testing
- Manufacturing
- Engineering process and best practices
- Leadership
- Mentoring and Career Guidance

I'm excited to share my knowledge and hopefully learn a few things from you! 

**Please enter your specific topic in the booking form.**
